# MovieTasteFlicks-Movie-Recommendation-Flask
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Flask and machine learning (KMeans clustering). It helps users find movies similar to ones they already enjoy, based on features like genres, popularity, and user ratings. The app uses unsupervised learning to group similar movies and recommends top-rated titles from the same cluster.
